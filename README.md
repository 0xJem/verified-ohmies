# Verified Ohmies

This is where the code for [Verified Ohmies](https://www.notion.so/olympusdao/Active-Projects-703c573f1fdc42af95035fce2dca2321?p=62e7d754a50140e3a7f5775efff3089d) lives, both frontend and backend. Verified Ohmies is a Discord bot that enables Discord users to prove they own Olympus tokens by signing a message with their wallet, and get a Discord role after successful authentication.

This is similar to what collab.land does for NFT’s, but here we have the added twist that we need to track several different tokens on several different chains.

### Problem: Why is this project needed for the DAO? Which issues are solved by it?

- Reduce the scamming attack surface on our Discord. Users can immediately verify who is a real Ohmie by checking whether they have the verification role.
- Exclusive channels for Olympus token owners could be created.
- Obtaining and keeping the verified role would be another incentive for Ohmies to keep doing (3,3).
- This would also open other avenues, such as enabling the creation of polls on Discord where only verified Ohmies could vote, such that the weight of their vote would be proportional to how many Olympus tokens they own.

### Outcome: How can we measure the success of the project?

- Expected Outcomes
1. Make our Discord safer and scammer-free.
2. Further encourage (3,3) by attributing a verified role.
3. Reinforce the trust between Ohmies.

- Measurable Objectives
1. The number of Ohmies on our Discord using the bot to authenticate themselves on a monthly basis.
2. The amount of scammer reports we’re getting on the server - the harder scammers’ life is, the less they’ll hang out on our Discord and look for lower hanging fruits.

### When: When does it ship and what are the milestones?

- The aim is to have v1 ready around the end of January 2022. This version will include only gOHM on Ethereum Mainnet.
- Taking what we learn from v1, we will incrementally add the rest of the Olympus tokens and the other chains.
